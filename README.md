# romaine

To test please run:
``` bash
python setup.py test
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
./run_lint
```

This has been tested in bash on Ubuntu Linux 14.04, and can reasonably be expected to work on other linux environments with compatible versions of python.

Should you encounter issues attempting to run tests on another platform that supports Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4, and has the find utility and bash available please raise an issue.
